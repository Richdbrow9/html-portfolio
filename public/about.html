<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Richard Brown, and these are some of the few things I would like to share with you about myself. I was 
  born in Augusta, Ga on September 2nd, 1992. I am the second born child in my family, and the first born son. A few
  things about are that I am very self-motivated person, and I take challenges personally because it is an opportunity 
  to better myself and grow. When faced with challenges, I see it as one of the hidden gems of life.</p>
  
  <p>I have faced many challenges in my life and the first was venturing into the technical field. Majoring in criminal justice in undergrad, I always
  believed that I would eventually go off to become an attorney or do some work in the field, but upon completing my 
  degree, my views on the field changed shortly after. That's when I discovered IT, and I was captivated with the work,
  earning two certifications (CompTIA A+ and Network+), and actaully qualifying for multiple jobs, consistantly maintained 
  employment in the field for 2 years, after being 100% self taught on all of it. Along the way in my technical journey, 
  I discovered coding and saw it as a new challenge, instantly thew myself into learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
  I completed numerous projects that are linked in this web page, and are all a product of late nights of studying, 
  implementing, and challenging myself to learn this craft in hopes of landing a job as software engineer. I hope that 
  you enjoy all of my creations.
